      <h2>The Boy from Delhi</h2>
<p>Even before the world named him "King Kohli," before the centuries, the roar, and the stadium hymns—there was merely a boy in Delhi with stars in his eyes and a bat in his hand.</p>
<p>Virat Kohli was born on 5th November 1988 in a small but vibrant house in Uttam Nagar, West Delhi. He was the youngest child of the family, having an elder brother, Vikash, and sister, Bhavna. His father, Prem Kohli, was a renowned criminal lawyer; he was strict but a doting father—and his mother, Saroj Kohli, was a humble homemaker with a kind heart and ensured that her son never slept hungry or despairing. They were not an affluent family, but a tight-knit, proud, and values-grounded one.</p>
<p>Even as a little boy, Virat was full of life. He was energetic, mischievous, and sharp. His family recalls how he’d swing his plastic bat around the house, trying to copy cricket shots he saw on TV. His favorite? Sachin Tendulkar. He would watch Sachin play and try to mimic his every move. It wasn’t just play—it was obsession. He once told a relative, “One day I’ll play for India, you’ll see.”</p>
</section>

<h2>The Early Journey and Hard Work</h2>
<p>At the age of 9, feeling his son's enthusiasm, his father had him enrolled in the West Delhi Cricket Academy, coached by coach Rajkumar Sharma. That is where Virat's journey truly started. The coach remembers the first day vividly: "He had something special in his eyes. I could tell." Virat's dedication was unparalleled. While most boys reported late or missed practice, Virat never missed a single class. Even if he were feeling feverish or under pressure at school, he would report for duty—bat in hand, fire in heart.</p>
<p>His childhood routine was tiring—school in the morning, cricket in the evening, and study at night. And still, he never complained. His mother used to pack him extra food for his lengthy days, and his father, in spite of a hectic law practice, would find time to drop him there for practice, sit there for hours, and silently watch him from the stands. Those hours spent with his father were the most valued moments of Virat's early years.</p>

<h2>A Tragic Loss and a Legendary Innings</h2>
<p>But fate had other things in store. In 2006, when Virat was only 18, tragedy befell.</p>
<p>Late one evening, his father—Prem Kohli—experienced a sudden brain stroke. The whole family rushed to the hospital, but he couldn't be salvaged. Virat was devastated. His father was not only a parent but also his greatest well-wisher, the man he admired all his life, his hero, and his first coach. This night, the house once full of laughter became quiet with sorrow.</p>
<p>But what followed became the stuff of legend.</p>
<p>The very next day, you see Delhi playing a Ranji Trophy game. Virat had to decide whether to weep or play. His family asked him to stay behind, but he stood up and said,"If I miss this match, I'll regret it forever. My father would've wanted me to play."</p>
<p>Thus, with tears in his eyes and a pain in his heart, Virat went out to bat, sporting black armbands. He played one of the grittiest innings of his career, hitting 90 runs, almost single-handedly taking Delhi on his shoulders. That day, he did not play a game. He kept an appointment. He played for his father.</p>

<h2>The Man with a Mission</h2>
<p>From that instant, something happened in him. He was no longer a boy full of passion—he became a man with a mission. He began taking cricket more seriously. He became tougher, quieter, and more determined. His family stood by him through thick and thin. His mother became extra protective. His brother assisted with finances. His coach became his second father.</p>
<p>But even then, he was just a lad attempting to cope with loss. His family and friends recall how he would not speak much about his father but had a picture of him in his bag. When he was anxious before a game, he'd quietly glance at it, compose himself, and go out to bat.</p>
<p>Virat Kohli’s early life wasn’t made of gold medals or silver spoons. It was built with early mornings, schoolbooks, playground dust, heartbreak, and sheer determination. It was shaped by a father's belief, a mother's prayers, and a child’s unbreakable will.</p>
<p>That’s the part of Virat’s story that the world doesn’t always see—the boy who became a legend not just by talent, but by heart.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        Virat attended Vishal Bharti Public School, where teachers noticed his sharp memory and leadership traits. Though not academic in the traditional sense, he was always alert, competitive, and full of spark. Cricket doodles filled his notebooks, and the playground was his true classroom.
      </p>
      <p>
        His close group of friends described him as funny, loyal, and fiercely protective. Whether it was school games or street cricket, Kohli gave his all. His early education built not just his mind, but also the values of friendship, discipline, and team spirit.

      <h2>Personal Traits</h2>
      <p><strong>1. Unshakeable Determination:</strong> Every run he scores is a tribute to his late father. For Virat, cricket is more than a sport — it's personal.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Fearless Aggression:</strong> His on-field intensity isn't arrogance — it's passion. He shows he cares by living every moment of the game.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Fitness Became His Religion:</strong> Virat transformed his lifestyle radically. His discipline redefined fitness in Indian cricket.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Mentally Resilient:</strong> Through slumps and criticism, he’s battled pressure like a warrior — admitting vulnerability, yet never giving up.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Emotional & Family-Rooted:</strong> His wife Anushka, daughter Vamika, and mother remain his anchors. Beneath the aggression lies a deeply sensitive man.</p>
      <p><strong>6. A Thinker of the Game:</strong> Not just a batsman — a strategist. He studies, plans, and lives cricket like a scholar of the sport.</p>
      <p><strong>7. A Leader Always:</strong> Even without a title, he inspires — through effort, passion, and belief in others.</p>
      <p><strong>8. Grounded & Self-Aware:</strong> Meditation, spiritual reading, and humility keep him centered despite fame.</p>
      <p><strong>9. Style From Confidence:</strong> Whether on magazine covers or stadiums, his style is real — born from inner confidence, not pretense.</p>
      <p><strong>10. A Heart That Gives Back:</strong> Through his foundation, he supports young athletes, underprivileged kids, and mental health. He believes in leaving a legacy of good, not just greatness.</p>
